# Ubuntu base image for agent-vm.
#
# This adds what a VM needs and a container image lacks: a kernel and
# initramfs, an init system, cloud-init for first-boot configuration, an SSH
# server, sudo, and the QEMU guest agent. Nothing else — a base image is shared
# by every VM built on it and cached indefinitely, so it must contain no
# credentials and no per-VM state (SECURITY.md).
#
# BASE_IMAGE is passed in pinned to a digest. Do not add a default that would
# let an unpinned tag be built by accident.
